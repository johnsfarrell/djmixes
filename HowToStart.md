## How-To-Run

Before you can run the whole application, install npm and all the necessary packages required using(might need to also run it in /client)
```
npm ci
```

Then build for the project using
```
npm run build
```
Then we can use command to start the frontend and backend
```
npm start
```

The frontend will listen on the port on 3000 and backend will listen on 3001
and we can access the web application at localhost:3000
